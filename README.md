Inspired by The Eight Fabled Blades mod for 1.12, this mod adds eight uncraftable swords with unique abilities and uses. Instead of crafting these swords, you must find them in vanilla structures like Strongholds or Nether Fortresses.

Location List:

Arrow Render: Dungeons and Abandoned Mineshafts
Sentinel Sword: Nether Fortresses and Dungeons
Leg Breaker: Strongholds and Woodland Mansions
Light Bringer: Desert Temples and Jungle Temples
Gaia Blade: Jungle Temples and Abandoned Mineshafts
Blood Gorger: Bastions and Nether Fortresses
Armor Piercer: Strongholds and Desert Temples
Dark Deceiver: Woodland Mansions and Bastions

Each sword is extremely rare and can only be repaired with Netherite, so use them wisely.

Sword Abilities:

Arrow Render: Hold right-click to block with the sword; nearby projectiles are slashed and destroyed.
Sentinel Sword: Hold right-click to block with the sword; briefly become invincible and immovable.
Leg Breaker: Hold right-click to charge up an attack; release to knock enemies back.
Light Bringer: Hits against undead have a chance to cause a holy explosion that applies "Holy fire" to undead. Undead kills always cause an explosion.
Gaia Blade: Full swings fire a wave in front of the player that pierces mobs.
Blood Gorger: Stores a percentage of damage dealt. Right-click to restore health with the stored damage.
Armor Piercer: Hold right-click to charge forward with increasing speed. Release to attack and apply "Armor Pierced" to the target.
Dark Deceiver: Right-click to summon a clone that draws enemy aggro. The player gains invisibility.

Sword Debuffs:

Armor Pierced: Removes 20% of armor and armor toughness by default. Stacks twice.
Holy Fire: Burns undead for 3% of their max health per second for 5 seconds.

Config:

Config options allow you to adjust ability damages, cooldowns, chance percentages, charge times, and loot table spawn chances.
